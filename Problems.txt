Q  :Given n coins with each coins having probablity pi. determine the probability of obtaining exactly k heads. 
	
Solution := Consider the situation when (n-1) coins are tossed together and nth coin is tossed apart and take into account mutual independence.

Combine probabilities of simpler cases to get P(1..n, k) (where P(1..n, k) is the probability of obtaining exactly k heads when n coins)

Then apply this rule and fill all the cells in NxK table

Edit:

There are two possible ways to get exactly k heads with n coins -

a) if (n-1) coins have k heads, and Nth coin is tail, and

b) if (n-1) coins have k-1 heads, and Nth coin is head

so

P(n, k) = P(n-1, k) * (1 - p[n]) + P(n-1, k-1) * p[n]
